""" About this Project:
To use deep learning to predict forest cover type (the most common kind of tree cover) based only on cartographic variables.
The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. 

The covertypes are the following:

  Spruce/Fir
  Lodgepole Pine
  Ponderosa Pine  
  Cottonwood/Willow
  Aspen
  Douglas-fir
  Krummholz
  
Project Objectives:
  1. Develop one or more classifiers for this multi-class classification problem.
  2. Use TensorFlow with Keras to build your classifier(s).
  3. Use your knowledge of hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of your model(s).
  4. Test and analyze performance.
  5. Create clean and modular code.
