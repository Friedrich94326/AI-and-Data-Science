""" The World Health Organization (WHO)â€™s Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository tracks life expectancy 
for countries worldwideby following health status and many other related factors. This dataset covers a variety 
of indicators for all countries from 2000 to 2015 including:
  1. immunization factors
  2. mortality factors
  3. economic factors
  4. social factors
  5. other health-related factors 
In this project, I will design, train, and evaluate a neural network model performing the task of regressionto predict 
the life expectancy of countries using this dataset.
